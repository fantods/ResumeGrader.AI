Al Engineer 1
Oct 2022 - Oct 2024
• Reduced cloud costs by 40% by rebuilding docker images to transition from AMD64 to ARM64 CPU architecture and redesigning infrastructure to improve efficiency
• Improved NLP inference model accuracy from 20% to 80% by applying transformations to training data
• Built and deployed ML models that assess fluency and soft skills by performing inference on written language and multimodal (audio, video) features
• Increased model transparency by creating docker images that enable inference models to serve realtime model explanations using SageMaker Clarify
• Built a model training pipeline that allows engineers to fine-tune models, perform hyperparameter optimization using WandB, and deploy NLP inference models to AWS SageMaker
